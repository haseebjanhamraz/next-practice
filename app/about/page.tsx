                The Bacha Khan Research Center (BKRC), established in 2007, is a prestigious educational and research institution located in Bacha Khan Markaz, Peshawar. Founded under the auspices of the Bacha Khan Trust, the center is a tribute to the legacy of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, famously known as Bacha Khan, a revered political leader, social reformer, and advocate of non-violence. He dedicated his life to the education and empowerment of the Pashtun nation, promoting the values of peace, unity, and self-reliance through education. The Bacha Khan Research Center was established to continue his lifelong mission of spreading knowledge and fostering intellectual growth among the people.

                Bacha Khan’s vision centered on the transformative power of education, particularly for marginalized and oppressed communities. He believed that true liberation comes through the enlightenment of minds. The Bacha Khan Research Center stands as a proud embodiment of this vision, providing a vital resource for scholars, researchers, students, and the general public who seek to explore and understand the rich history, culture, and struggles of the Pashtun people. It plays a pivotal role in preserving the historical and intellectual legacy of the Khudai Khidmatgar Movement, which was led by Bacha Khan to promote non-violence and social justice.
